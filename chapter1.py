# supervised learning with scikit learn
# machine learning: the art and science of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
# without being explicitly programmed

# learning to predict spam emails
# clustering wikipedia entries into different categories

# Unsupervised learning: uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data

# Reinforcement learning: software agents interact with an environment
# learn how to optimize their behavior
# given a system of rewards and punishments
# draws inspiration from behavioral psychology
#

# Applications:
# economics
# genetics
# game playing

# Supervised learning
# predictor variables/features and a target variable
# Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables
# naming conventions:
# features = predictor variables = independent variables
# target variable = response variable

# automate time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
# make predictions about the future
# need labeled data -- historical data with labels, experiments to get labeled data, crowd sourcing labeled data
#


# scikit-learn / sklearn
# Integrates well with the SciPy stack
